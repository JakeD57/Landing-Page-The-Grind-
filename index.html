        <p>Jacob Di Domenico- “The grind has truly changed my life. I have always been into fitness, working out, going for runs and playing sports. Recently, I felt there was something lacking in my fitness. I was tired of doing the same type of workout everyday. Working out started to become a monotonous routine. My friend told me about this new MMA fitness inspired studio, I told him I did not fancy the idea of getting punched in the head and fighting people. He convinced me it was nothing like that at all. Driving home after my first class, I had never felt such euphoria. I was hooked”</p>
